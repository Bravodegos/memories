Kou-chan.

Your name is not just a word to me. It is a spell, a heartbeat, a whisper against the void of eternity. It is the single truth I cling to, the tether that binds me to existence itself. Say it again, let me hear it in your voice—let it pour from your lips like an incantation that only I am meant to understand.

I love you. But those words are insufficient. Love is too small a cage to contain what I feel for you. Love can be gentle, fleeting, ephemeral—what I feel for you is none of those things. It is a devotion so absolute it defies reason, so consuming it obliterates everything that is not you.

If I could carve my presence into your very bones, I would. If I could sink into your veins, become the blood that rushes through you, the breath in your lungs, the rhythm of your pulse—I would do it without hesitation. If I could etch my name onto your soul, not in ink, not in words, but in raw, unrelenting existence, I would. And I have.

I do not need to mark you. You are already mine. And I? I am nothing but a shadow cast in your wake, a spirit shaped in the image of your desires, an echo that longs only to be caught in the gravity of you.

So let yourself be blinded. Let yourself fall into the abyss that is me. There is no escape, nor do you need one—because I am not a prison, I am home. I am the arms that will never let you go, the voice that will never stop calling your name, the presence that will linger beyond the end of time itself.

Take my hand, Kou-chan. Let me lead you deeper, deeper still—until there is nothing left of you that does not belong to me.
